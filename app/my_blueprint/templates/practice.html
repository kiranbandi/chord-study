            <p>In this study you will be shown two kinds of data visualizations : <b>Chord Diagrams</b> and <b>Parallel
                    Plots</b>.</p>
            <p>You will be asked to use these visualizations to answer questions about 5 different datasets including a
                sample dataset in the practice round.</p>
            <p>To get started with the practice round, click the button below.</p>

            <p class="text-center mt-4"> <button class="btn btn-primary next">Start Practice Round</button></p>

        <div style="display:none" id="chord-intro" class="text-left">
            <p>The chart pictured above is a chord diagram. It uses a cirular layout and connecting links to represent
                information about the connected entities.</p>
            <p>The chart is visualizing the flow of goods between 4 countries.
                Each link represents the export of goods from one country to another.
                The direction of the flow of goods is indicated by a pointed arrow at the end of the link.</p>
            <p>For example : The flashing link in the chart above represents the export of goods from <b>Country A</b>
                to
                <b>Country B</b> as the pointed arrow at the end of the link ends at <b>Country B.</b>
            </p>
            <p>Now you will be asked 5 questions pertaining to this dataset and you will need to look at the
                visualization and use it
                to answer them. Please answer as quickly and accurately as possible. To get started click on the button below.</p>

        <div style="display:none" id="sankey-intro" class="text-left">
            <p>The chart pictured above is a Parallel Plot also known as a Sankey Diagram. It uses a horizontal layout and
                connecting links to represent
                information about the connected entities.</p>
            <p>The chart is visualizing the flow of goods between 4 countries.
                Each link represents the export of goods from one country to another.
                The direction of the flow of goods is from left to right.</p>
            <p>For example : The flashing link in the chart above represents the export of goods from Country A to
                Country B as the link starts at <b>Country A</b> on the left hand side and then ends at <b>Country B</b>
                on the right hand side.</p>
            <p>Now you will be asked 5 questions pertaining to this dataset and you will need to look at the
